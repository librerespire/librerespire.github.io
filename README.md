## Introduction

In order to address the scarceness of ventilators across the world caused by Covid -19 global pandemic, a team of professionals volunteered to design a low-cost ventilator. Initially the team was formed on 15th March 2020 with few members and to date it is growing stronger with members from disciplines like medical, engineering, IT etc.
The project will be an open source design and all files will be made available online as the project progresses.  



## The Need

COVID-19 has caused many issues due to its extremely infectious nature. Around 20 % of the persons infected are faced with respiratory problems and need to be hospitalized. Due to its rapid spread more and more people are getting infected daily and this causes heavy strain on the healthcare systems. This has led to a higher demand for ventilators which has resulted in a shortage. 

## Objective

- Design the ventilator with easily sourced/manufactured or off-the-shelf components.
- Maintain total cost of manufacture of the ventilator within affordable range, especially to support developing countries.
- ensuring a safe, reliable and robust design on par with industry standards.
